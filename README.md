# ðŸŽ„ Darren's Advent of Code  ðŸŽ„

My solutions to the [Advent of Code][1] puzzles written in various
programming languages. I love solving programming puzzles, and this
allows me to explore different languages in a fun way.

Given that, these are just my solutions to the problems.
There are likely cleaner, faster or more idiomatic ways to
solve them in a given language. (if so, please drop me a line
and let me know how to improve them).

## Support the cause if you can

The Advent of Code is an awesome event that we can all look forward to each
year. If you can, please support Eric's efforts at:

## Current languages

I currently have solutions in various forms for:

- [dart][2] - Used [Dart][3] a lot when I was on the [Flutter][4] team, and to sharpen my skills with it.
- [clojure][5] - Really love [Clojure][6], but it has been years since I used it for anything.

## Input files

The input files needed for these solutions come from the
[Advent of Code][1] site and are customized for each user. They
have [requested][7] that these input files are not made publicly
available. Therefore I have encrypted them in the top level `input`
directory using [git-crypt][8] following [this guide][9]. However, 
you can specify a different location if you want to run them against
your own input by using the "-DAOC_INPUT_DIR=<some path>' command line
option to any of the language runners.

### Answer files
In addition to the raw input files mentioned above, I also store a 
`DD_answer.json` file for each day's problem that has the form of: 

```json
{
  "name" : "Not Quite Lisp",
  "answer1" : 42,
  "answer2" : 4242
}
```

This gives the name of the problem and the solutions for my input.
These answer files allow me to write tests against them to make sure 
I don't break anything when solving new problems.
